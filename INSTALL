There are only a few dependencies:
 * PLplot
 * pthread (POSIX)
 * rt (message queues, available on almost all Linux systems)

The default install on Ubuntu should be:

* sudo aptitude install libplplot-c++10

However, it results in an error on my system: 
* undefined reference to `plstream::line(int, double*, double*)

Hence, I compiled the plplot library from source:
* cd ~/temp
* apt-get source libplplot-c++10
* mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DENABLE_qt:bool=OFF; make; sudo make install

This will install in /usr/local instead of /usr, so probably be found before the system lib (but that depends on your system).

Have fun!
